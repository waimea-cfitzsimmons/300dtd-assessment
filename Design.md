# The Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Tabletop Character Index**

Project Author: **Cameron Fitzsimmons**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

People who play table top games often have to keep track of physical character sheets which are easily lost or destroyed. They are also very tedious to update as they eventually get smudged with erased text or scribbled out pen. It is also difficult for the game master to keep track of all of the npc's information and stats as well.
### End-User Requirements

The end users will be people who play table top games (such as Dungeons and Dragons)

### Proposed Solution

I propose a website that acts as a database that users can use in order to: Create player and Game Master accounts, create and store character and npc information and track character's health and abilities during combat.
