# The Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Tabletop Character Index**

Project Author: **Cameron Fitzsimmons**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

People who play table top games often have to keep track of physical character sheets which are easily lost or destroyed. They are also very tedious to update as they eventually get smudged with erased text or scribbled out pen. It is also difficult for the game master to keep track of all of the npc's information and stats as well.
### End-User Requirements

The end users will be people who play table top games (such as Dungeons and Dragons)

### Proposed Solution

I propose a website that acts as a database that users can use in order to: Create player and Game Master accounts, create and store character and npc information and track character's health and abilities during combat.


-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant Implications

### User Control and Freedom

This means that when a user makes a mistake or changes their mind that they are easily able to undo that action or back out of whatever they are doing.

It is important as a user could easily choose the wrong character or for the Game master to choose the wrong npc or input the wrong information

This means that I will have to make sure that the user can easily remove/swap out characters or edit/undo information about characters/npc's once they have changed it.

### Consistency and Standards

It means that the user shouldn't have to wonder what words or symbols mean and using standard or commonly used words/symbols.

If there are lots of difficult to understand symbols and words it will make it hard for the user to understand what they are doing or how to use the website..

I will need to always remember to use simple and common symbols in order to make sure that the user can understand the website clearly and easily.

### Help Users recognise, Diagnose and Recover from Errors

Make it so that users can easily tell when someone has gone wrong with an error message and suggest a solution to the problem

If an error occurs on a website and its not clear to the user then it can be very frustrating for the user as they have no idea what is wrong or why the website is not working.

I will need to have error pages that have clear simple messages explaining what has happened and what the user can do (e.g 404 error would tell the user that the page cannot be found and that they should try refreshing or using a different page)

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
