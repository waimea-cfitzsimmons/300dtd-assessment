I figured how the website should interlink and flow and decided that the user should start at a sign up/in page and then be sent to a main page where everything can be accessed from that page. I also decided that there will be two types of accounts a Player account who can make playable characters and view the campaign and npc information, and a game master who can create and add players too campaigns, make and manage npc's and view player character's information.
