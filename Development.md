## Design, Development and Testing Log

### 16/05/2024

Created the first design of the database and how it would interlink

![First version of database](images/db1.png)

Figured out on how the database should be set up and interlink together. Got a basic idea of the layout of the website/ how it should function on a simple level.

### 17/05/2024

Making a flowchart using Excalidraw to decide the basic flow of the website

I figured how the website should interlink and flow and decided that the user should start at a sign up/in page and then be sent to a main page where everything can be accessed from that page. I also decided that there will be two types of accounts a Player account who can make playable characters and view the campaign and npc information, and a game master who can create and add players too campaigns, make and manage npc's and view player character's information.
