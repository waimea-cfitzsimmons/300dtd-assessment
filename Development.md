I figured how the website should interlink and flow and decided that the user should start at a sign up/in page and then be sent to a main page where everything can be accessed from that page. I also decided that there will be two types of accounts a Player account who can make playable characters and view the campaign and npc information, and a game master who can create and add players too campaigns, make and manage npc's and view player character's information.

Added more details and changed around some of the font sizes and placement

added backgrounds to certain things on the page after end user's said the website seemed bland. I also made the titles bigger after end users commented that it looked very empty at the top of the pages. I also added a basic color scheme with a end user that we experimented various colors with.
