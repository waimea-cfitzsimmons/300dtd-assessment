# The Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Tabletop Character Index**

Project Author: **Cameron Fitzsimmons**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

People who play table top games often have to keep track of physical character sheets which are easily lost or destroyed. They are also very tedious to update as they eventually get smudged with erased text or scribbled out pen. It is also difficult for the game master to keep track of all of the npc's information and stats as well.

### End-User Requirements

The end users will be people who play table top games (such as Dungeons and Dragons). This will especially be useful for people who have a difficult time keeping track of physical copies or keeping documents organised. this will also be advantageous for people who have difficulties writing with a pen and paper (such as people with dyspraxia) since it will allow them to type it up instead. This website would also help Dungeon masters organise and distribute information about the campaign and characters.

### Proposed Solution

A website that acts as a database and also a sort of wikipedia for tabletop games and campaigns that people are hosting allowing users to store their information and make and manage campaigns. Users should be able to:

Create accounts with a secure password

Create a campaign that the creator of the campaign will be able to add other users to as players

Create characters that will be stored on a database and will be able to be viewed by other players (but not edited)

track and edit the stats and information about their characters

access everything from a secure database

-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant Implications

### Accessibility 

This means that everyone can user the website no matter what device they are using or if they have a disability such as color-blindness, dyslexia or a vision impairment. 

This is relevant to this website because there is a very diverse group of people who play tabletop games and could use this website and it is also very likely that users would use a mobile device or laptop rather then a PC.

I will need to make sure that as I design and evolve the website and the UI that I keep in mind what it looks on mobile and smaller screens and keep it so that the website functions and is usable on all devices. I will also have to make sure that the color tones and combinations are contrast enough that people with poor vision will be able to read them easily as well as selection a good font to use for smaller screens and that isn't hard for people to read.

### Functionality 

This means that the website works as intended and that it has a good experience for the end user in terms of serving its purpose. 

It is important for a website to work properly as intended otherwise there is no point in the website. Also I think I fail if my website doesn't function. 

I will have to error test every time I update the website and let my end users use it multiple times over the course of development in order to make sure that there are no bugs or errors in my website and that everything is working as intended. 

### Usability

Usability is one of the most important implications as it involves how well the website is able to be used and accessed by its intended end-users. Usability is a very broad category but it was very clearly defined into subcategories by Jakob Nielssns with his 10 heuristics. These heuristics are: 

1: Visibility of System Status
2: Match Between the System and the Real World
3: User Control and Freedom
4: Consistency and Standards
5: Error Prevention
6: Recognition Rather than Recall
7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
10: Help and Documentation 

Since there is already an alternative to my website (going back to pen and paper) then if I do not make the website usable or make it too difficult to understand then there is no reasons for the end-users to user my website.

I will have to make sure I follow Nielsens 10 heuristics most importantly:


-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant User Experience (UX) Principles

### User Control and Freedom

This means that when a user makes a mistake or changes their mind that they are easily able to undo that action or back out of whatever they are doing.

It is important as a user could easily choose the wrong character or for the Game master to choose the wrong npc or input the wrong information

This means that I will have to make sure that the user can easily remove/swap out characters or edit/undo information about characters/npc's once they have changed it.

### Consistency and Standards

It means that the user shouldn't have to wonder what words or symbols mean and using standard or commonly used words/symbols.

If there are lots of difficult to understand symbols and words it will make it hard for the user to understand what they are doing or how to use the website..

I will need to always remember to use simple and common symbols in order to make sure that the user can understand the website clearly and easily.

### Help Users recognise, Diagnose and Recover from Errors

Make it so that users can easily tell when someone has gone wrong with an error message and suggest a solution to the problem

If an error occurs on a website and its not clear to the user then it can be very frustrating for the user as they have no idea what is wrong or why the website is not working.

I will need to have error pages that have clear simple messages explaining what has happened and what the user can do (e.g 404 error would tell the user that the page cannot be found and that they should try refreshing or using a different page)

## Final System Design

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *final design* of your database: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place images here that show your *final design* of your UI: layout, colours, etc.


-------------------------------------------------

## Completed System

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *actual database structure* that you implemented: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place screenshots and notes here that show your *actual system UI* in action.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
