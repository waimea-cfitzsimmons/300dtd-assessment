Figured out on how the database should be set up and interlink together. Got a basic idea of the layout of the website/ how it should function on a simple level.

Making a flowchart using Excalidraw to decide the basic flow of the website

I figured how the website should interlink and flow and decided that the user should start at a sign up/in page and then be sent to a main page where everything can be accessed from that page. I also decided that there will be two types of accounts a Player account who can make playable characters and view the campaign and npc information, and a game master who can create and add players too campaigns, make and manage npc's and view player character's information.

End users made several comments about the design of the website. They said that the text at the top of some of the screens was to small and that it made it look empty. They also commented that the welcome screen text was too cluttered. They also pointed out several small UI changes that should be made such as the pop out menu buttons overlapping on certain pages. 

I acted apon the user feedback by making the heading text larger and more centeral. I also changed the welcome page to only say "welcome". I also touched up smaller areas of the UI and added a backdrop to certain areas in order to make it less empty.
